Duration: November 20th,2024 to January 5th,2025
Mentor:

Objective
The main purpose of the program is to:-
Provide users with a simple and interactive way to perform basic arithmetic operations.
Ensure error handling and user-friendly output messages to guide the user throughout the process.
Serve as an educational tool for beginners in programming, demonstrating the use of conditional logic and error handling.

Key Features

Supported Operations:-
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/), with safeguards against division by zero.

Error Handling:-
Ensures valid operation selection.
Prevents crashes due to invalid numeric input (e.g., letters or special characters).
Handles division by zero with an appropriate error message.

Interactive User Input:-
Guides users step by step to choose an operation and input numbers.
Provides immediate feedback based on the user's choices.

Clear Feedback:-
Displays descriptive results for all operations.
Offers an informative error message for invalid inputs.

Lightweight:-
The program is simple and requires no external libraries, making it portable and easy to run.

Technology Used
Programming Language:-
Python: Chosen for its readability and support for interactive console applications.

Core Concepts Demonstrated:-
Input/Output: Captures user input using input() and provides feedback using print().
Control Flow: Uses if-elif-else for decision-making.
Exception Handling: Uses try-except to manage invalid inputs.

Execution Environment:-
Can be run in Python environments like:
IDLE (default Python IDE)
VS Code, PyCharm, or any terminal.

Strengths
Error-Resilient: Catches and informs users about incorrect inputs and invalid operations.
Simple and Clear: Easy to understand for new programmers or non-technical users.
Reusable: Users can restart the program to perform other calculations.

Enhancements
Loop for Continuous Use:-
Allow the user to perform multiple calculations in one session instead of restarting the program.

Advanced Operations:-
Add more mathematical operations like modulus (%), power (**), and square root.

GUI Integration:-
Create a graphical version using Tkinter or PyQt.

Persistent History:-
Store past calculations for reference during the session.

Web-Based Version:-
Convert this calculator into a web app using frameworks like Flask or Django.

Educational Use
This program serves as an excellent project for beginners, showcasing:
Control Flow: Decision-making using if-elif-else.
Error Handling: How to use try-except blocks effectively.
User Interaction: Engaging users through input prompts and clear output.
